# Almaal

Ever had a money management crisis? Forgot to update your excel sheet? Or maybe you can't recall how much you owe to a friend?

Our team has come up with Almaal, a money management web application which will resolve your money related issues.

## What is the purpose of this sofware?
### Our product helps people to easily split, manage, and understand their expenses.

We will build a web application that will allow users to input and track their daily expenses, add friends into the expense distribution chart, include or exclude certain friends from the group when splitting a bill and connect with a safe payment method that is used by everyone in their social circle to sort out the money.


## Who is our target audience?

Almaal is a productivity and management tool that is built for college students, graduates and for the people who are transitioning into adulthood. In short, it is a tool for someone who is seeking to make their finance matters easier and clearer for themselves and their friends/family. 

## How does it work?

A user will be able to add their credit or expenses on this application. You can add a friend on the website using their unique username. Each expense added in the app can be tagged and shared with acquaintances. The user and each acquaintance will have a shared account of all the expenses that are split between themselves. At any time, the users can settle the amount left to split among themselves using an integrated payment gateway (or the person who is owed the money can settle on the app).

### Scope

The UI for the project will be fairly simple. The main focus will lie on visualizations, which will be fairly straightforward to implement with chart.js. The main focus of the project will be on the backend, especially on database design. However, it should be doable if we focus multiple people's concentration during the backend sprint.
